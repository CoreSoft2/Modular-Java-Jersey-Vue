    <b> Side-Nav </b>
    <div class="p3" style="padding:16px; color:#999; width:300px;text-align:justify">
       It is a custom component done to match the styling and behavior of Sonicwall's recommended pattern. The component is totally configurable and supports localization.
       <br/><br/>
       It Works in conjunction with the header, where a selection of Header item will automatically sync the sidenav to show links related to the selected header item.
      <br/><br/>
        It also has router integration built into it. Which means you may type a link on the URL bar of the browser and the sidenav will highlight the proper section.
      <br/><br/>
      SideNav and Header both are designed to maintain state across page refreshes. That is to say, if the user presses refresh on the browser, it won't take him/her to the home page
