      Application-Header is a custom component done to match the styling and behavior of Sonicwall's recommended pattern. The component is totally configurable and supports localization. You may add any number for Header-Items to it
      <br/><br/>
       Header Works in conjunction to SideNav, where a selection of Header item will automatically sync the SideNav to show links related to the selected header item.
      <br/><br/>
     SideNav and Header both are designed to maintain state across page refreshes. That is to say, if the user presses refresh on the browser, it won't take him/her to the home page
